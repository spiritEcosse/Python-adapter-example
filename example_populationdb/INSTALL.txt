X-road client/server example using PyXadapterlib library
========================================================

Installation
------------
If you have not installed PyXadapterlib library, do it now (see ../pyxadapterlib) because it is required by this example.

The following instructions assume that /usr/local/pyxadapter is path of the sandbox where PyXadapterlib has been installed.

Install dependendancy packages:

    sudo /usr/local/pyxadapter/bin/python setup.py develop

Create SQLite database and load some initial data:

    /usr/local/pyxadapter/bin/initialize_Population_db development.ini


Run SOAP server with pserve
---------------------------
To run SOAP server with pserve:

    /usr/local/pyxadapter/bin/pserve --reload development.ini 

Now you have a local SOAP server running at:  http://localhost:6543/adapter

WSDL file is available as: http://localhost:6543/static/populationdb.wsdl


Run SOAP demo client
--------------------
Assumed that the SOAP server is up and running at localhost (see pserve in previous section),
open another terminal window and run the client:

    /usr/local/pyxadapter/bin/python -m populationdb.client

In client window, you should see some data retrieved from the server.

By default, populationdb/client.py is set to use services at localhost. 
You can edit file to use services via security server.

Install SOAP server for Apache/mod_wsgi
---------------------------------------
The example SOAP server is WSGI app.
For production environment it is recommendable to use Apache/mod_wsgi instead of pserve.

The following instructions have been tested in Ubuntu 16.04.3 Server.
Install Apache and mod_wsgi:

    sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3

Copy database file into the place which will be accessible from the server process:

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/pyxadapter/var
    sudo cp populationdb.sqlite /usr/local/pyxadapter/var
    sudo chown -R www-data /usr/local/pyxadapter/var

Example production configuration file is populationdb.ini.
Note that database connect string is in the configuration file:

    sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///usr/local/pyxadapter/var/populationdb.sqlite

Copy configuration file into the sandbox:

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/pyxadapter/etc
    sudo cp populationdb.ini /usr/local/pyxadapter/etc

Create logging directory which is described in the configuration file:

    sudo mkdir /var/log/pyxadapter
    sudo chown www-data /var/log/pyxadapter

Install the package contents into the sandbox:

    sudo /usr/local/pyxadapter/bin/python setup.py install

Note that WSGI app (and configuration file path) is described
in /usr/local/pyxadapter/apache/populationdb.wsgi (the file was copied by setup.py).

Copy example Apache configuration and enable:

    sudo cp apache/adapter.conf /etc/apache2/conf-available
    sudo a2enconf adapter

File adapter.conf describes that URL /populationdb will be alias for our WSGI app.
You may wish to modify configuration file to restrict access to the app etc.

Edit /etc/apache2/envvars, find LANG and set it's value to UTF-8 character set:

    export LANG=en_US.utf8

Restart Apache:

    sudo service apache2 restart

Now you have a local SOAP server running at: http://localhost:80/populationdb/adapter

WSDL file is available as: http://localhost:80/static/populationdb.wsdl

To test those services, edit populationdb/client.py and set
xroad.security_server to 'localhost'
xroad.security_server_uri to '/populationdb/adapter'

Then run client like before:

    /usr/local/pyxadapter/bin/python -m populationdb.client

To provide services via X-road, configure those URLs in your security server.
To use the services via X-road, edit populationdb/client.py and set correct values
for security server and it's URI.
