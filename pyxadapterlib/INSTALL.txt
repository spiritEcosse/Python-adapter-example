PyXadapterlib INSTALL
=====================

This is a library for implementing X-road SOAP server and SOAP client applications.

Example installation has been tested in Ubuntu 16.04.3 Server.

Install python and virtualenv if you do not have them already:

    sudo apt-get install python3 virtualenv

Create a python3 sandbox for PyXadapter.
This example uses /usr/local/pyxadapter as a directory for the sandbox.
You may replace it with some other directory if you wish.
To create the sandbox:

    sudo virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/pyxadapter

Unpack pyxadapterlib package and go the folder of the library (if you are not here already):

    tar xzf pyxadapterlib_*.tgz
    cd PyXadapter/pyxadapterlib

Install the library:

    sudo /usr/local/pyxadapter/bin/python setup.py install

Now you have the library installed.
The library itself does not provide any services.
For example usage of the library, see examples in the parent directory.
